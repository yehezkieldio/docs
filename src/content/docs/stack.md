This is a list of the technologies, tools, and services that I use on a daily basis.

#### Text Editor

**Visual Studio Code** is my primary text editor, and I also sometimes use **Visual Studio** and **NetBeans** for college-related tasks and projects. Additionally, **Notion** and occasionally **Obsidian** are used for note-taking, personal knowledge management and documentation.

#### Operating System

My primary operating system is **EndeavourOS**, an Arch-based Linux distribution. I also use **Windows 11** for compatibility with certain applications and college-related tasks. It's not a dual-boot setup; I use **Windows 11** on a another machine.

> Currently using **GNOME** as the desktop environment, with considerations to switch to **Xfce** or **Budgie** back in the future or maybe even a tiling window manager.

#### Terminal

I use **Warp** as my terminal emulator with **Fish** as the shell, never tried **Zsh** before and probably never will. Moved from **Alacritty** ever since and never looked back.
